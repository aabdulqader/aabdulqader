Hello!

I am a full-stack web developer and developing web apps using the following areas:
Python, Javascript(ES6), MySQL, Django, Django Rest Framework, React, jquery, Redux, HTML5, CSS3, Restfull API, Sass Bootstrap, Material UI, Git.

I am also familiar with the following areas: SQL, Ajax, Docker, Webpack, and Testing.

I am passionate about software and technology. I love finding elegant solutions to difficult problems and really enjoy the act of coding. I love to program things that work in the real-world and useful for people in their business. I am professional, reliable and responsible for the work I do.

I love to build special, unique and amazing websites from the ground up and rapidly create a prototype for you or your business. If youâ€™ve got something existing that needs to be upgraded, I also love working with legacy systems.

Factors that I always keep in mind while developing a website are responsive front end user interface, optimized back end admin interface, optimized database queries, security techniques implementation, etc.

I pride myself on being proactive, a strong communicator, and a great team player.

My working hours are very flexible. I am always available both online and offline. I generally work more than 100 hours a week and therefore wish that you will consider me the best match for your job.

Thanks.
